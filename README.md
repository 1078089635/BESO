## Topology Optimization for Python using Bidirectional Evolutionary Structure Optimization (BESO)

This is a Python package that allows you to run topology optimization problems using the bi-directional evolutionary structure optimization (BESO) method. This code was written based on work done for the 2D case by Xie and Huang in the book, Evolutionary Topology Optimization of Continuum Structures: Methods and Applications.


Below is an example of a cantilever beam generated with this optimization process.
